# Electricity-Demand-Prediction-Project
Electricity Demand Prediction System Using Time Series Analysis.

In this project, I developed a time series analysis model to predict electricity demand accurately. The goal was to assist
energy providers in optimizing power generation and distribution, leading to improved resource allocation and cost-efficiency.
Key Steps:
1. Data Collection: Gathered historical electricity consumption data, including time-stamped records of power usage from
various regions.
2. Data Preprocessing: Performed data cleaning and handled missing values and outliers.
3. Time Series Analysis: Employed techniques like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) or Seasonal
Autoregressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA) to identify patterns and seasonality in the electricity
consumption data.
4. Model Selection: Evaluated different time series models and selected the best-performing one based on metrics like
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
5. Model Training: Trained the selected time series model using historical data and validated its performance on a holdout test dataset.
6. Future Demand Prediction: Utilized the trained model to forecast electricity demand for future time periods, allowing
energy providers to plan ahead.
7. Visualization: Visualized the predictions and provided insights to stakeholders using graphs and charts, aiding
decision-making processes.
